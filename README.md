# Personal Website Portfolio

<img alt="home page image">

**My personal and self-coded website portfolio.**

I decided to build my personal portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, studies, and evolution. This project serves as both a representation of my capabilities and a personal challenge, encompassing everything from conceptualization (design) to execution.

## Built with
Using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Why I use these technologies:
As it is initially a simple, static website intended to provide an overview of myself, I opted not to use frameworks or similar tools to avoid potential future complexities and overengineering. Keeping it straightforward aligns with the project's purpose at the beginning.

## Sections
- About
- Skills
- Projects
- Links to social media and other information

## Design
From the outset, the design proposal has been minimalist and straightforward. After experimenting with various layout types, I settled on the current design, which aligns perfectly with the project's concept.

### Design Inspirations
My main inspiration was the portfolio of [bchiang7](https://github.com/bchiang7). You can check out their portfolio [here](https://brittanychiang.com/).

## Contributing
I am new to the world of open source, and I don't have a thorough understanding of how it works. However, if you'd like to make suggestions for improvements or any other feedback, please create an 'issue'.
